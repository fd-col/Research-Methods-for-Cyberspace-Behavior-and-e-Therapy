## Load dataset from YALE0065_OUTPUT_cleaned.xlsx file

```{r}

library(car)

# Load the data (update the path as needed)
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("YALE0065_OUTPUT_cleaned.xlsx", sheet = "Combined sheet")
```

### *generation* and *educ* into factors and relabeling

```{r}
# Convert generation and educ to factors
data$generation <- as.factor(data$generation)
data$educ <- as.factor(data$educ)

# Relabel `generation` according to the schema
data$generation <- dplyr::recode(data$generation,
                          "z" = "Gen Z (1997–2012)",
                          "y" = "Millennials (1981–1996)",
                          "x" = "Gen X (1965–1980)",
                          "b" = "Boomers (1946–1964)",
                          "s" = "Silent generation (1928–1945)")

# Relabel `educ` according to the schema
data$educ <- dplyr::recode(data$educ,
                           "1" = "No HS",
                           "2" = "High school graduate",
                           "3" = "Some college",

```

### TWO-WAY ANOVA

```{r}
# Run the ANOVA
model <- aov(Risks_Average ~ generation * educ, data = data)

# View the summary of the results
summary(model)
```

-   *No main effect of **generation** ( p \> 0.05)*.

-   *No main effect of **educ** ( p \> 0.05)*.

-   *No **interaction** effect* *( p \> 0.05);*

### Compute the Effect Size

```{r}
# SS values from the ANOVA summary
SS_generation <- 8.2
SS_educ <- 1.6
SS_interaction <- 22.0
SS_residual <- 1024.5

# Calculate partial η² for generation, education, and interaction
partial_eta2_generation <- SS_generation / (SS_generation + SS_residual)
partial_eta2_educ <- SS_educ / (SS_educ + SS_residual)
partial_eta2_interaction <- SS_interaction / (SS_interaction + SS_residual)

# Print results
cat("Partial η² for generation:", partial_eta2_generation, "\n")
cat("Partial η² for education:", partial_eta2_educ, "\n")
cat("Partial η² for interaction:", partial_eta2_interaction, "\n")
```

### Check assumptions

```{r}
# Homogeneity test
leveneTest(Risks_Average ~ generation*educ,data= data, center="mean")
```

```{r}
# Perform Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(data$Risks_Average)
```

### Visualize results

```{r}
# Compute summary statistics

            se = sd(Risks_Average, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()))
